## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- HTML Forms
- Mobile-first workflow
- [https://boxicons.com] (https://boxicons.com) - I copied the social media icons from this website.


### What I learned

- I coded the design for mobile and desktop sizes. The curved images arenÂ´t appropriately sized for tablet sizes. 
- Using contact form API: creating a form which sends the data to the given email address after submitting the form. I followed the instructions of the website [https://web3forms.com]. The code below:

```html
 <form action="https://api.web3forms.com/submit" method="POST" id="form">

          <input type="hidden" name="access_key" id="access-key" value="db073e47-3004-42f4-9242-64af4e35b60b">

          <label for="email" style="display: none; width: 0rem; height: 0rem;">E-mail</label>
          <input type="email" name="email" id="email" spellcheck="true" contenteditable="true">
          <input type="hidden" name="redirect" id="redirect" value="https://web3forms.com/success">
          <button type="submit" id="email" class="subscribe">Subscribe</button>
        </form>
```
